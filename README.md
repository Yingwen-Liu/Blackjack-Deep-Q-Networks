# Blackjack-Deep-Q-Networks

The win ratio is around 43% while using 2 decks of cards. Not able to split.

- Run `train.py` to train and test the model
- Run `blackjack.py` to play Blackjack manually
- Btw, this DQN counts cards, which you should not do in reality.

*You will 100% lose money from Blackjack as you play more and more, no matter how*
