# Blackjack-Deep-Q-Networks

The win rate is around 40%. Need more fine-tuning for further use

- `train.py` is the code to train and test the model
- Run 'main.py' to play Blackjack manually
- Btw, this DQN counts cards, which you should not do in reality.

*You will 100% lose money from Blackjack as you play more and more, no matter how*
